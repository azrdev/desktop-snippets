Configuration example and a small publish script for my "dumphost".

The idea is that the root folder is not indexed but there can be collections in subfolders that are autoindexed.
These collections should have then hard-to-guess names of course!

As this host only allows sftp access (and to be honest, more is not needed to publish and manage published files) I wrote a small script to easily upload files to new collections.
